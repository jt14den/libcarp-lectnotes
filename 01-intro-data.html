##Library Carpentry: Some Basics

### UC Berkeley Library - 10/10-11

???

* Before we crack on with using the computational tools at our disposal:
* I want to spend some time on some foundation level stuff
- a combination of best practice and generic skills that frame what you'll encounter across Library Carpentry.

#### Where to go for help

1. Skill level near you
2. Helpers 
3. Signal for help with colored sickies

---
### Jargon Busting (Group Task)
1. Start by getting into groups of 5 or 6.
2. Next make a big list of all the problem terms, phrases, and ideas that come up. **Retain duplicates**. 
3. Then (taking common words as a starting point) work together to try and explain what a term, phrase, or idea means (note: use both each other and the internet as a resource!). Make a note of those your group resolves and those you are still struggling with. **15 minutes**
4. Report back on an issue resolved by your group **1 minute each**


???

#### Requirements

- boards/pads
- pens
- sticky notes*

- {Trainer}: alongside this make a note of common problem terms, phrases, and ideas that both do and do not map to what Library Carpentry will cover (paying special attention to common problems that will not be covered)}
- {Trainer}: Report on mapping exercise: what is and isn't going to be covered.
