# What is OpenRefine

> A tool for working with ‘messy’ data
---

It can help you:

* Get an overview of a data set
* Resolve inconsistencies in a data set
* Help you split data up into more granular parts
* Match local data up to other data sets
* Enhance a data set with data from other sources

???
Some common scenarios might be:

* Where you want to know how many times a particular value appears in a column in your data
* Where you want to know how values are distributed across your whole data set
* Where you have a list of dates which are formatted in different ways, and want to change all the dates in the list to a single common date format
---

For example:

| Data you have   | Desired data |
|-----------------|:-------------|
| 1st January 2014| 2014-01-01   |
| 01/01/2014      | 2014-01-01   |
| Jan 1 2014      | 2014-01-01   |
| 2014-01-01      | 2014-01-01   |

####Where you have a list of names or terms that differ from each other but refer to the same people, places or concepts. For example:

| Data you have   | Desired data |
|-----------------|:-------------|
| London          | London       |
| London]         | London       |
| London,]        | London       |
| london          | London       |
---
####Where you have several bits of data combined together in a single column, and you want to separate them out into individual bits of data with one column for each bit of the data.

> Address in a single field:

>'University of Wales, Llyfrgell Thomas Parry Library, Llanbadarn Fawr, ABERYSTWYTH, Ceredigion, SY23 3AS, United Kingdom'
---
####Where you want to add to your data from an external data source:

| Data you have   | Date of Birth from VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) | Date of Death from VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) |
|-----------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Braddon, M. E. (Mary Elizabeth) | 1835 | 1915 |
| Rossetti, William Michael       | 1829 | 1919 |
| Prest, Thomas Peckett           | 1810 | 1879 |
